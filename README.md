# Genshin Impact Adventure!

A small python command line game. Made to test myself on my basic Python skills!
This is a day 3 of Python project so there might be a couple mistakes. Publishing this to keep track of my progress and get used to using github.

I made the .bat file so it can auto run the game in command prompt and for proper colors for the command prompt background and text. It also loops infinitely so you can try diffrent routes. 

**Needs Python installed to run the bat file**
